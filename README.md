# FUTURE_DS_02: Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker
**Project Overview**

This project, FUTURE_DS_02, is a Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker created using Power BI. It provides a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and analyze the performance of social media advertising campaigns. The dashboard includes key metrics such as impressions, clicks, spend, and conversions, as well as calculated metrics like Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Return on Investment (ROI).

The main goal of this project is to give stakeholders a clear, visual representation of campaign data, helping them make data-driven decisions to optimize their advertising efforts.

# Key Features
Performance at a Glance: The dashboard features key performance indicators (KPIs) for a quick overview of total impressions, clicks, spend, and approved conversions.

**Cost and Efficiency Metrics:** It includes calculated metrics like CPC, CPA, CTR, and ROI to help assess the efficiency and profitability of campaigns.

**Demographic Insights:** A pie chart visualizes the distribution of clicks by age, allowing for an analysis of which age groups are most engaged.

**Engagement Analysis:** Two tables highlight the top-performing ads based on the highest number of clicks and the highest engagement rate, providing actionable insights for optimizing future campaigns.

**Gender-based Filtering:** The dashboard includes a slicer to filter all visuals by gender, enabling a deeper dive into how campaigns perform with male and female audiences.
